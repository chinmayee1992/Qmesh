Notes: 
1) Set Mesh.CharacteristicLengthExtendFromBoundary=0(default) in Mesh.py module of the qmesh plugin
2) Donot use the arguments for smallestnotMeshedarea and smallestMeshedarea for identifyPolygons() in vector.py module of the qmesh plugin.
Issues to address: The boundaries over waterbody are considered as land boundaries for boundary refinement.
